# Project Title

This project is created using a stack of modern technologies including React, TypeScript, ShadCN, RadixUI, Zustand, and SWR.

## About the Libraries

- **ShadCN**: A rapidly growing UI library that allows us to have all the component code on our side, providing total freedom over customizability.
- **Zustand**: A lightweight and easy-to-use state management library. Although there was no need for state management for this case, it was added to showcase its capabilities.
- **SWR**: A robust library for data fetching and mutation.
- **Jest**: Used for unit testing, with test cases written for the cart.
- **Cypress**: Used for writing end-to-end test cases.
